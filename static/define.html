   			<p>Actions meant to hurt someone’s feelings or devalue them are bullying/harassing behaviors. Bullying is a form of harassment. “Bullying/harassment” refers to behaviors such as saying hurtful things to someone about their appearance or ability, posting disrespectful comments about someone online, hurting someone by physical actions, or treating someone badly or making a point of excluding them because of who they are. Such behaviors are often directed repeatedly against the same person or group, and they can happen on or off school grounds.
 
Bullying/harassment is not accidental. Although some students may feel pressured by their peers to bully or harass someone, they are still participating in behavior that is meant to hurt or upset another person or group of people.
 
Different forms and types of bullying/harassment are described below. </p>
